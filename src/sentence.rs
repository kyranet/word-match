	/// The spans of the sentence that will be checked by the `Word` class. The

	///
	/// When the sentence is created, the `spans` vector is initialized with a
	/// single span that covers the entire sentence (0, `contents.len()`). When
	/// a word is checked, the span is split into two spans, one that covers the
	/// start of the sentence and the other that covers the end.
	///
	/// If only non-word characters are between two spans, they merge into a
	/// single span. Spans are at least one character long. Surrounding non-word
	/// characters are included in the span.
	///
	/// For example, if the sentence is "Pepe ate a banana", the `spans` vector
	/// will be initialized with a single span (0, 17).
	///
	/// If the word "ate" is checked, the `spans` vector will be updated to the
	/// spans:
	/// - `(0, 3)` "Pepe"
	/// - `(9, 17)` "a banana"
	///
	/// If the word "Pepe" is checked, the `spans` vector will be updated to the
	/// spans:
	/// - `(9, 17)` "a banana"

	/// The `spans` vector is also always sorted by the start of the span.
	pub(crate) spans: Vec<(usize, usize)>,
	/// A vector of `Boundary` that represent the boundaries of the words in the
	/// sentence.
	///
	/// This vector is updated when a span is marked, updating the surrounding
	/// boundaries to reflect the start and end of a word.
	///
	/// For example, if the sentence is "A Pepe", the `boundaries` vector will
	/// be initialized with the boundaries:
	/// - `Mixed` "A"
	/// - `NoContent` " "
	/// - `Start` "P"
	/// - `Word` "e"
	/// - `Word` "p"
	/// - `End` "e"
	///
	/// If the word "Pepe" is checked, the `boundaries` vector will be updated
	/// to the boundaries:
	/// - `Mixed` "A"
	/// - `NoContent` " "
	/// - `Marked` "P"
	/// - `Marked` "e"
	/// - `Marked` "p"
	/// - `Marked` "e"
	///
	/// Similarly, if the slice "Pep" is checked, the `boundaries` vector will
	/// be updated to the boundaries:
	/// - `Mixed` "A"
	/// - `NoContent` " "
	/// - `Marked` "P"
	/// - `Marked` "e"
	/// - `Marked` "p"
